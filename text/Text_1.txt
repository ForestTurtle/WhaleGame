  One hundred years ago, a large and powerful race known as
The Whales began their conquest of the seas around 
them. One by one, each region fell under control of the
Whales. The Whales' wrath knew no end.

  The Whales controlled of the entire sea under their dominion. 
Only 20% of the world was left free from the whale's rule: the land.
The people and creatures on land felt safe from the whales
and prospered. People were happy and thought nothing of the
Whales' conquest of the world.
  However, this was not to last...

  The Whales were greedy. They lusted for control of the entire
world and were not satisfied was just 80%.
  So, the Whales conceived a most ingenious device that allowed
them to come onto land--- The Ambulocetus or Ambus for short.

  It was so sudden... The Whales attacked! With the help
of their Ambus, the Whales took each island one at a time.
However, there was hope. The Ambus are not perfect; they 
have a time limit and limit the whale's strength. The Whales 
could only continue their conquest in short intervals. 
The Whales were weaker on land.

  Abusing this defect, several archipelagoes and islands have
defended against the whale's menacing attacks. Today, the archipelago
Flow is the largest and safest human civilization.

  Flow is made up of four Islands.
Each Island has their own specialty.

#back1
  The main Island of Polaris.
This is where the government of Flow is located. All decisions,
major and minor, are made here. It is full of high-level 
educational facilities and upper-class architecture.

#back2
  The agriculture island of Chow.
This place is the main food supply of Flow. The people here 
live modestly and happily.The population consists of farmers, 
traders,and houseworkers.

#back1
  The sailor island of Sun.
This is where adventurers are born! The people here know danger 
and battle like the back of their hands. Fishermen, sailors,
adventurers, and all the like are raised here.

#back2
  The technology island of Mint.
This island is very secretive and disconnected. Although the
other islands would love to know what goes on behind the
closed walls of Mint, a compromise has been made. As long as
the people of Mint support the rest of Flow with their 
technologies, the rest of Flow should not probe into Mint's
matters.

  Come on, man; help a guy out here. I'll have money soon; 
a drink isn't too much to ask for.

  No way, no way. You know our motto, no bucks no booze.
If you want a drink, you're going to have to pay up front.
Now, please leave, you're disturbing the other customers.

  The one day I forget my wallet! I've been drinking here for
years now, Cooper. Is it really too hard to do a friend a 
favor and spot me a drink?

<BARTENDER, Cooper>
  Sir, if all the no good ruffians around here got free
beverages, this place would be out of business within a week.
Especially with the new anti-whale tax on all liquid products!
Hmph, they say it's to fund the war against the whales, but I
think they're just greedy.

  They're using the new tax to fund mercenaries. The rewards are
actually pretty good. But, the whales are too scary, man.
